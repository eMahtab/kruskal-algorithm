# Kruskal's Algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm is used to find the minimum spanning tree of a graph using Disjoint Set (Union/Find).

## Algorithm :
1. First sort the edges of the graph in the ascending order of their weights.
2. Iterate over the sorted edges and perform the union operation if vertices are not already in same set.
3. If `union operation was performed then` add the weight of the edge to MST's total weight and `increase the count of number of edges in MST by 1`
